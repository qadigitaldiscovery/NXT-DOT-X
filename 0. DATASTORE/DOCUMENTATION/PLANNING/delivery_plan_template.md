*   **Backend & Database:** [e.g., Supabase (PostgreSQL, Edge Functions), Node.js/Express, Python/Django]
*   **Frontend:** [e.g., React/TypeScript, Vue.js, Angular]
*   **Language:** [e.g., TypeScript, Python, Go, Java]
*   **API Communication:** [e.g., RESTful APIs, GraphQL, gRPC, WebSockets]
*   **Other Key Technologies:** [e.g., Message Queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ), Caching (Redis), Specific Libraries/SDKs]

## 4. Phased Development Plan:

The development will be structured iteratively to deliver core capabilities incrementally.
