## 6. Data Architecture

### Entity Relationship Overview
The system utilizes a relational database structure with the following key entities:

- **Users**: Core entity representing system users with authentication credentials and roles
- **Suppliers**: Organizations or individuals providing goods/services
- **Customers**: Entities purchasing or consuming products/services
- **Documents**: Files and structured documents with metadata
- **Costs**: Financial records associated with business operations
- **Products**: Items or services offered by the business
- **Loyalty Programs**: Structured reward systems for customer engagement

### Data Flow Patterns
The system follows consistent data flow patterns:

1. **CRUD Operations Flow**:
   - Frontend form/interface → API request → Database operation → Response → UI update

2. **Authentication Data Flow**:
   - Credentials → Validation → Token generation → Protected route access

3. **Analytics Data Flow**:
   - Raw data sources → Data aggregation → Processing → Visualization components

### Data Storage Approach
- **Relational Data**: Stored in Supabase PostgreSQL tables with proper relationships
- **Document Storage**: File storage system for documents and attachments
- **Local Storage**: User preferences and non-sensitive session data
- **Caching Layer**: TanStack Query for API response caching and state management

## 7. User Roles & Permissions

### Core User Roles
- **Admin**: Full system access with configuration capabilities
- **Manager**: Access to business operation modules with limited configuration
- **Analyst**: Read access to data and analytics without modification rights
- **Standard User**: Basic access to assigned modules only

### Permission Matrix

| Feature/Module         | Admin | Manager | Analyst | Standard User |
|------------------------|-------|---------|---------|---------------|
| User Management        | Full  | None    | None    | None          |
| System Configuration   | Full  | Limited | None    | None          |
| Cost Analysis          | Full  | Full    | Read    | Limited       |
| Supplier Management    | Full  | Full    | Read    | Limited       |
| Customer Management    | Full  | Full    | Read    | Limited       |
| Document Management    | Full  | Full    | Read    | Limited       |
| Tech Hub               | Full  | Limited | None    | None          |

### Authentication Flow
1. User submits credentials through login interface
2. System validates credentials against stored, hashed values
3. On successful validation, JWT token generated with role/permission claims
4. Token stored in secure context with appropriate expiration
5. Protected routes and components check token validity and permissions
6. Conditional rendering based on user role and specific permissions

## 8. Integrations Overview

### Authentication and Database
- **Supabase Integration**
  - Purpose: Core authentication and data storage
  - Integration Type: Direct API connection
