# Future Testing Improvements

The following areas have been identified for future enhancement of our testing infrastructure:

## 1. Component Test Generation
- Add support for different component types (hooks, HOCs, etc.)
- Implement intelligent prop type detection
- Add customizable test templates
- Support for complex component hierarchies

## 2. Mock Data Handling
- Create comprehensive mock data generators
- Add support for complex state scenarios
- Implement realistic API response simulation
- Add support for WebSocket mocking

## 3. CI/CD Integration
- Set up automated test runs in CI pipeline
- Configure test coverage thresholds
- Implement performance testing benchmarks
- Add visual regression testing

## 4. Edge Case Testing
- Expand auth test scenarios
- Add network error simulation
- Implement boundary testing for data inputs
- Add load testing capabilities

## 5. Coverage Reporting
- Set up detailed coverage reporting
- Configure coverage thresholds
- Implement trend analysis
- Add branch coverage metrics

## Implementation Timeline

These improvements will be implemented in future iterations to enhance the testing infrastructure. Priority will be given based on:

1. Impact on development workflow
2. Complexity of implementation
3. Team feedback and requirements
4. Project roadmap alignment
